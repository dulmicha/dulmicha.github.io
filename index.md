### Projects

I'm currently working on various projects, but one for _Narzƒôdzia informatyczne_ is closest to my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è

### [Most valuable project!](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne-2021-2022/Pisali-Hello-World-w-przedszkolu)
## Short note 
We intended to make our own varation of the popular "Battleships" game. Our language of choice is C. The game is made as a project for "Narzƒôdzia Informatyczne" university course. Our teams' members are: [Arkadiusz Paterak](https://asgardianvoyager.github.io/), [Szymon Jurecki](https://caiiguia.github.io/), [Micha≈Ç Duda](https://m-adud.github.io/m-adud/), [Dominik Breksa](https://dominikbreksa.github.io/) and me. During our cooperation we succeeded in developing our project to satisfactory stage as a team. We hope that You'll enjoy your play with our game üôÇ
